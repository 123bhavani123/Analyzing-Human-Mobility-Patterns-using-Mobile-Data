# Analyzing-Human-Mobility-Patterns-using-Mobile-Data
This project focuses on analyzing human mobility patterns using geospatial mobile location data. It leverages clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN), prediction models (e.g., XGBoost), and visualizations to derive insights from location trajectories.This project analyzes and predicts human mobility patterns using mobile location data. It combines geospatial clustering, machine learning, and interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights. The goal is to predict future travel locations, visualize trajectory movements, and support smarter urban planning, public safety, and real-time decision-making.
