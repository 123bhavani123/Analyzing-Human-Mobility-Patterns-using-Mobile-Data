# Analyzing-Human-Mobility-Patterns-using-Mobile-Data
This project focuses on analyzing human mobility patterns using geospatial mobile location data. It leverages clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN), prediction models (e.g., XGBoost), and visualizations to derive insights from location trajectories.
